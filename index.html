<h3><u>Things I Have Added:</u></h3>
<p>I have added a head tag which inside of it I control the styles(colors and borders) of some of the text which in that of itself, the color and borders are seperate and unique tags I also added. I added a tag that centered the text on the screen as well as added an underline to "Things I Have Added" I also have included a link to a livestream on YouTube of LoFi Beats! <br> And I have also included an image of Gangster Spongebob and the background image of the sky of Bikini Bottom as well as another image of Gary as a librarian. In regards to the images, I have added a dimension tag to edit their height and width as well as a white border around both images. Throughout my journey doing this I found it very frustrating, addicting, and above all, wanting to learn more HTML and CSS to further edit my site especially as it relates to formatting and design.
